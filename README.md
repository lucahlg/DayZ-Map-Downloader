## How it Works ‚öôÔ∏è

The application functions by:

1.  **Selecting Map Parameters**: You choose the desired map (e.g., ChernarusPlus-Top), its version, and the resolution level from the sidebar.
2.  **Downloading Tiles**: The app connects to `maps.izurvive.com` to download individual map tiles based on your selections. It stores these tiles locally in a `tiles/` directory.
3.  **Stitching Images**: Once all tiles are downloaded, the application stitches them together into a single, large image.
4.  **Display & Download**: The final stitched map is displayed in the application, and you're provided with a button to download it.

### Prerequisites

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (or copy the `day_map_downloader.py` code into a file named `day_map_downloader.py`):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lucahlg/DayZ-Map-Downloader.git
    cd DayZ-Map-Downloader
    ```

2.  **Install the required Python packages**:

## Usage üéÆ

1.  **Select Map**: In the sidebar, choose the DayZ map you wish to generate (e.g., "ChernarusPlus-Top", "Livonia-Sat"). The map version will automatically update.
2.  **Select Zoom Level**: Choose a zoom level. Higher zoom levels offer more detail but will result in larger file sizes and longer download times.
3.  **Generate Map**: Click the **"Generate Map"** button.
4.  **Wait for Processing**: The application will display progress as it downloads and stitches the tiles.
5.  **View and Download**: Once complete, the generated map will appear, and a **"Download Map Image"** button will become available to save the map to your computer.
